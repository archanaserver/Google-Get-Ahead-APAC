## Week 1 

Well! Week 1 was all about to kick off the first Get Ahead YouTube Live Session. 

The session was all about introduction to Get Ahead and participants involvement in this. It was so amazing session.ðŸ§¡

#### Some points that I got to learn from this session:

1. Broaden tech skill set by practicing it.
2. Learn concepts and try to apply it in some technical challenges.
3. To crack technical challenges practice, practice and practice. 
4. Communication is important when you are solving problems.
5. The more time you put in, the more your will get out!
6. Explore, develop and hone your skillset.

Ya! That's it ðŸŒ¸
